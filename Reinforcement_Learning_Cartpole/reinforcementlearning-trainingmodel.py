    ### Rewards

    Since the goal is to keep the pole upright for as long as possible, a reward of `+1` for every step taken,
    including the termination step, is allotted. The threshold for rewards is 475 for v1.

    ### Starting State

    All observations are assigned a uniformly random value in `(-0.05, 0.05)`

    ### Episode End

    The episode ends if any one of the following occurs:

    1. Termination: Pole Angle is greater than ±12°
    2. Termination: Cart Position is greater than ±2.4 (center of the cart reaches the edge of the display)
    3. Truncation: Episode length is greater than 500 (200 for v0)
